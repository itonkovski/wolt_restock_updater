📦 Wolt Stock Reset Automation – Documentation
Automated system to fetch menus from Wolt, detect FORCED_OUT_OF_STOCK items, and reset them to available (in_stock: true) across multiple venues.

🔧 Tech Stack
- Google Cloud Functions (2nd Gen, Python 3.12)
- Google Cloud Scheduler (runs daily at 07:00 Oslo time)
- Wolt POS API (Basic Auth)
- Cloud Logs for observability
- Configurable via venues.json

📁 Project Structure
- cloud_function/
- main.py                  # Cloud Function logic
- requirements.txt         # Dependencies for Cloud deployment
- venues_bakeries.json     # Bakery venues config
- venues_groceries.json    # Grocery venues config

- local_tests/
- test_main.py             # Local entrypoint for testing
- local_test.py            # Mock runner
- config_loader.py         # Loads JSON configs
- menu_fetcher.py          # Downloads menu from Wolt
- sold_out_extractor.py    # Filters sold-out items
- restock_handler.py       # Sends in-stock update
- retry_utils.py           # Manages per-venue wait/retry config
- test.json   

🧩 Features
- Fetches latest menu for each venue
- Detects sold-out items (inventory_mode == FORCED_OUT_OF_STOCK)
- Restocks by setting { in_stock: true }
- Supports both gtin and fallback to sku
- Can exclude specific GTINs/SKUs per venue
- Supports multiple config files (via ?config= param)
- Logs activity and errors per venue
- Local testing without touching Cloud Functions
- Temporary menu snapshot to /tmp/

🔐 Notes
- Basic Auth credentials required per venue
- Use "excluded_skus" or "excluded_gtins" fields in your config JSON
- Items in exclusion lists are skipped during restocking
- /tmp is writable in Cloud Functions; used for debug snapshots
- 401 errors → wrong credentials
- 429 errors → Wolt rate limit hit

⏰ Scheduling
Cloud Scheduler triggers the function every day at 07:00 Oslo time.

gcloud scheduler jobs create http restock-daily \
  --schedule="0 7 * * *" \
  --http-method=GET \
  --uri=https://.../reset_sold_out_items \
  --time-zone="Europe/Oslo" \
  --location=europe-west1


🚀 Manual Trigger
You can manually test the function:
curl https://europe-west1-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/reset_sold_out_items
Or locally (for testing, not cloud):
python3 main.py
